# Changelog (12-14-2023)
Hello! I did a lot this update! Heh heh. Without any commits so that should be fun. Developer learning actual coding and practices at a young age.

# Major Updates
**So far, the desktop application is complete, you can freely use it!**
However, there's a new web version being made. Currently, I'm using Flask's framework, but I might switch over to Django in a little bit. I just wanna learn the basics of web frameworks in Python.

*Also I'm being smarter about shit like organization*


## Desktop Application
It's released!! Just find it in the releases section of the repo.

## Flask Application
Like I said earlier, WIP!! I'm just working on learning right now, and not really deploying just yet. I still don't even know how to make total points with cookies.. 

Code's up though! Feel free to open up a PR I guess.
